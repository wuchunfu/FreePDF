#### Field Description

- `models.doclayout_path`: DocLayout-YOLO ONNX model path.

- `fonts`: Font path for PDF rendering in various languages.

- `translation.service`: Translation engine, supports Bing, Google, Silicon, Ollama, and custom.

- `translation.lang_in`/`lang_out`: Source/target language, supporting en (English), zh (Chinese), ja (Japanese), ko (Korean), and zh-TW (Traditional Chinese).

- `translation.envs`: API parameters for different translation engines. The configuration method is exactly the same as `qa_engine.envs` below; see the typical configuration example below for details.

- `qa_engine.service`: Question answering engine, supporting off, silicon, ollama, and custom.

- `qa_engine.envs`: API parameters for different question answering engines. The configuration method is exactly the same as `translation.envs` above; see the typical configuration example below for details.

- `qa_settings.pages`: The range of PDF pages analyzed during question answering, formatted as "1-5,8,10-15".

- `qa_settings.system_prompt`: Question answering system prompts; the `{pdf_content}` placeholder represents the specific document content.

#### Typical Configuration Example

- **Silicon-based Flow Translation/Question Answering**:

``json

"service": "silicon",

"envs": {

"SILICON_API_KEY": "Your API Key",

"SILICON_MODEL": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct"

}
``
- **Ollama Local Large Model**:

``json

"service": "ollama",

"envs": {

"OLLAMA_HOST": "http://127.0.0.1:11434",

"OLLAMA_MODEL": "deepseek-r1:1.5b"

}
``
- **Custom OpenAI Compatible API**:

``json

"service": "Custom",

"envs": {

"CUSTOM_HOST": "https://api.xxx.com",

"CUSTOM_KEY": "Your Key",

"CUSTOM_MODEL": "Model Name"

}
```

> Whether for translation or Q&A, the envs field is filled in exactly the same way; only the corresponding parameters need to be filled in according to the selected engine.

> It is recommended to edit the configuration file with Notepad/VSCode, etc. Note that JSON format should not have comments; all comments are for reference only.


Optional Translation Engines:

- Bing Translation (Default)

Selecting Bing as the translation engine requires no additional parameters.

- Google Translate

Selecting Google as the translation engine requires no additional parameters.

- Silicon-based Translation

Selecting Silicon as the translation engine requires additional configuration of the [Silicon Flow](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/bjDoFhPf) API Key and the specific chat model.

- Ollama Translation

Choose Ollama as the translation engine. First, deploy a local chat model using Ollama and configure the Ollama address and specific chat model.

- Custom Translation

Other custom model engines compliant with the `OpenAi API`, such as Volcano Engine.

Supports mutual translation between five languages: Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, and Traditional Chinese.

The question-answering engine supports Silicon-based streaming (online), Ollama (local), and other custom methods compliant with the `OpenAi API`.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

1. Does it support image-based PDFs, such as scanned documents?

**Answer:** No. Essentially, it uses `pdf2zh` to detect text block content and then translates and replaces it. Image-based PDFs cannot be directly replaced, which would result in overlapping content.

2. When using a large model for translation, some content is not translated?

**Answer:** Large models with low parameter counts often have poor instruction compliance, making them unresponsive to translation and causing this issue. Therefore, when translating large models locally, it's crucial to ensure they have a sufficient parameter size, ideally 7 bytes or more.

3. Why are the contents of the table not translated?

**Answer:** pdf2zh currently does not support translating table content. To translate tables, please check the `dev` branch of this repository and use `pdf2zh_next`. However, due to its slow speed, it hasn't been merged into the main branch.
